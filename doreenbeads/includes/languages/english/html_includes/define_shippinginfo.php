    A: <font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000">When packing your parcels, our professional staff will use different kinds of materials, such as bubble-wrap, foam peanuts, thick plastic and cardboard to protect your package.

    <strong>A: </strong>For EMS delivery, parcels must be received and signed for by the addressee (or someone at the house). <br />
    EMS never leaves the parcels unattended. If there is no one at home when parcels arrived, the deliveryman will contact you by phone(if you have provided your number), and then manage to get you receive your parcels. <br />
    If they cannot get you on the phone, and after delivering for another several times, they still couldn't contact you, they will return the items back to us. If this happened, you need to pay additional shipping charge for redelivery. Therefore, in order to make the delivery on time and conveniently, we encourage you to leave your phone Number to increase safety and avoid unnecessary delivery delays.</span></span><br />

    <span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span id="A5"><span class="STYLE1"><strong> Q: If some items are out of stock when parcels are ready to ship out, what will happen?  </strong></span></span><font size="2"><strong><a href="http://www.doreenbeads.com/shippinginfo.html#TOP">[Return to Top]</a></strong></font><br />
    <strong>A:</strong> <font color="#0000ff"><font color="#000000">For short items: <br />
    We normally use airmail(taking about 10-19 days for shipping) to ship them out when they are available again <strong>or</strong> or ship them out with your next order <strong>or</strong> with equal credit for you, which depends on you.<br />
    <font color="#FF0000">Note: for short items, you do not have to pay any shipping fee again.</font> <br />
    <br />
    <strong>If previous shipping method you choose is express shipping, why we use airmail for out of stock items? </strong><br />
    Here some explanation will be given in the following part. <br />
    1. We have shipped many parcels out everyday, for all items we listed, we have stock generally, but sometimes some item may run out of stock unexpectedly. So in order to avoid delay, we will ship available items out at first.<br />
    2. For short items, if we shipped them out by express shipping method separately, the shipping fee would be much more expensive. Express shipping fee of one parcel(with 1kg) and two parcels(one with 0.8kg, the other with 0.2kg) make great difference. That is why it is hard for us to use express shipping for all short items, hope you could kindly understand. If you need them very urgenlyt, please do not hesitate tocontact us.We will try best to meet your needs.<br />
    3. We suggest that for not very urgent items, you could ask us keep them for you then ship them out together with your next order. <br />
    Sorry for any inconvenience to you. Thank you for your kind understanding.<br />
