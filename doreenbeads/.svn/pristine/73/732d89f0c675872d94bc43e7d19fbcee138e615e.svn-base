We do not collect Financial information (credit card number, credit card expiration date, billing address, etc.) from you. PayPal is the secure payment method and has been integrated into our website. When you are sending payment, you will be shifted to PayPal website( which normally starts with <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">http://www.paypal.com/</a>......).&nbsp; The PayPal account and password you input will be submitted to PayPal website, instead of ours. PayPal will never give us your PayPal account and password.</font><br />

<font face="Arial, Verdana, san-serif" color="#000000">8Seasons does&nbsp;not use any type of pop-up advertising on our web site. Our true feelings about this ugly advertising is that each of us should have the choice whether or not we want to view what is offered.</font><br />
